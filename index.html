  <p><em>Aspiring Coder & Environmental Enthusiast</em></p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I am a registered (non-practising) psychologist with postgraduate training in counselling pyschology.
    My psychology practice has spanned various industries and include the disability employment services sector, EAP, schools and private practice.
    Over the last three years I have applied my skills as a trained psychologist within the Australian higher education sector at a private
    Psychology College in management and busniness administration as the College Registrar.
    The experience offered opportunities to lead and manage projects in system acquisition and integration, futhered my understanding
    of business adminstration principles, and sparked an interest in coding.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am now on a career change pathway hoping to combine coding, project management, business administration, and Psychology
    in a new career as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I hope, in future, to work with environmental technologists and engineers
    to apply my coding skills in the development of new and helpful ways to assist in conservation of ecological systems.
    This website is where I chronical my experience and progress through blog posts and it serves as a portfolio of my work.
